# 2048AI
This is a project where I attempt to get a AI to play 2048 optimally.

My first task was to create the 2048 game itself which is contained in the environment file.

The next task is to actually get the AI to play the game. I have had some success so far with a monte carlo method.

My ultimate goal is to find a general algorithm to achieve the theoretical maximum score in a 3x3 grid. (2^8)
